# Text-to-Excel Sign Sheet Parser

This Python script reads text files containing attendance or sign sheets  
With a pattern like:  
S.No | Roll Number | Name | Sign(1) | Sign(2) | ... | Sign(n)

It extracts the data and saves it into neatly formatted **Excel (.xlsx)** files.

the code
- Supports a dynamic number of sign columns (you choose `n` at runtime)
- Reads all `.txt` files from an input folder
- Outputs one Excel file per input file
- Automatically creates the output folder if it doesn't exist

Requirements:
- Python 3.7+
- pandas
- openpyxl (needed by pandas to write Excel)
